This project is written in C++ for Advanced Programming midterm project. These are some features that are implemented:
  - The code is modular and every part and library can be used independently.
  - We have implemented object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns in the project.

For running the code you can use the commands below ðŸ‘‡ :

`g++ main.cpp && ./a.out`
